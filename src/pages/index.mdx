## Abstract

Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) provide new opportunities for blind and low vision (BLV) people to access visual information in their daily lives. However, these models often produce errors that are difficult to detect without sight, posing safety and social risks in scenarios from medication identification to outfit selection. While BLV MLLM users use creative workarounds such as cross-checking between tools and consulting sighted individuals, these approaches are often time-consuming and impractical. We explore how systematically surfacing variations across multiple MLLM responses can support BLV users to detect unreliable information without visually inspecting the image. We contribute a design space for eliciting and presenting variations in MLLM descriptions, a prototype system implementing three variation presentation styles, and findings from a user study with 15 BLV participants. Our results demonstrate that presenting variations significantly increases users’ ability to identify unreliable claims (by 4.9x using our approach compared to single descriptions) and significantly decreases perceived reliability of MLLM responses. 14 of 15 participants preferred seeing variations of MLLM responses over a single description, and all expressed interest in using our system for tasks from understanding a tornado’s path to posting an image on social media.

Design space for surfacing MLLM variations. `Alternatives` marked with backticks indicate the choices implemented in our prototype system. 

We elicit variants by running multiple **trials** (repeated queries), using different **prompts**, and querying multiple **models**. We then compare MLLM-generated descriptions at the granularity of **atomic facts** (individual descriptive claims) and present variations using a **list** format, a **variation-aware description**, and a separate **variation summary**. 

## Support Indicators

We provide three support indicators (**language**, **percentage**, and **source**) to show how many of each model agree with each claim.

## Results

**Surfacing variations in MLLM responses significantly increased the number of unreliable claims identified** by 4.9x for **ours** or 4.2x for **list** compared to presenting a **single** description. **Variations also significantly decreased the perceived reliability of MLLM responses** from 5.78 of 7 for a single description to 4.76 for a list of descriptions and 3.93 for ours. 

<Figure>
  <Picture slot="figure" src="../assets/results_bars.pdf" alt="Two bar charts compare three presentation styles—Single (red), List (yellow), and Ours (blue)—on two metrics: the number of identified unreliable claims (left) and perceived reliability (right). The left chart shows that Ours led to significantly more unreliable claims being identified across all categories (Overall, Model Limitation, Image Quality, and Subjectivity). The right chart shows Single descriptions were rated highest in perceived reliability, followed by List, with Ours rated lowest in several categories.

11 of 15 participants ranked our **variation summary (ours)** as their favorite option with 9 of 15 ranking it as their second favorite, while only 5 participants rated the list or single description as their first or second favorite, indicating strong support for our aggregated variation approaches.

All BLV participants wanted to use our variation surfacing prototype in the future for a variety of purposes from **high-stakes scenarios** such as assessing the path of an incoming tornado to **obtaining subjective critiques** for social media posts.
